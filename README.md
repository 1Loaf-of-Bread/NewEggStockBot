# NewEggStockBot
This program checks the NewEgg.ca website every 30 minutes to check if your item is in stock. If the item is in stock, then it will send you an email saying that the item you linked, is in stock, providing you with the direct link to the item along with the price.


When inputting the sender email, make sure you enabled the option for 3rd part software logins so that your email provider does not block this program from sending the email to the recieving email.
